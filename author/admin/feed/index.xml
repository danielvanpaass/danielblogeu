<p>It was very exciting to start with a project that I knew would take a whole year. The focus on the first weeks really was on getting to know the team and boats in general. All interaction that we had before was a Zoom speeddate of 2 minutes with each other team member. We were meeting at the &#8216;Ketelmeer&#8217; to watch the 2020 team sail in their self-organized competition. Due to Covid the competition in Monaco was cancelled, and that is why they asked Twente, Sunflare and Clafis to race. It was a nice opportunity to see the upcoming team, but the boat was very  for a long part of the race so that was unfortunate. </p>

<p>And of course it was also time to actually do some work! For us this meant becoming verhuis B.V. (meaning a moving company). Due to Covid, the Dreamhall had to be closed for a year for renovations to happen. This is the hall where all previous teams had their office and workplace, so this meant that a lot of stuff had to be moved to have an office at the Schiehallen. The Schiehallen was the place where we would temporarily have our office, and later even a workplace. </p>

<p>Here we could be found daily from 9AM till 5PM, talking about what would be our scope and our mission&amp;vision. It was more orientation than actually building something, but that&#8217;s a good way to start a project. We had to sit in a certain way so that distance to each person could be kept which was a bit weird at first, but you get used to it. </p>



<p>Another thing that we did, was fun activities and expirements that were not necessarily related to building boats, this was to bring us closer as a team but also force you to think creatively.</p>
